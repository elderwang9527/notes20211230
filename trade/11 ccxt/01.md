### 代理 Proxy

```
Python Proxies
The python version of the library uses the python-requests package for underlying HTTP and supports all means of customization available in the requests package, including proxies.

You can configure proxies by setting trust_env to True(default to False) and setting the environment variables HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY.

import ccxt
exchange = ccxt.binance({
    'trust_env': True
})
$ export HTTP_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:3128"
$ export HTTPS_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:1080"
After exporting the above variables with your proxy settings, all reqeusts from within ccxt will be routed through those proxies.

You can also set them programmatically:

import ccxt
exchange = ccxt.poloniex({
    'proxies': {
        'http': 'http://10.10.1.10:3128',  # these proxies won't work for you, they are here for example
        'https': 'https://10.10.1.10:1080',
    },
})
Or

import ccxt
exchange = ccxt.poloniex()
exchange.proxies = {
  'http': 'http://10.10.1.10:3128', # these proxies won't work for you, they are here for example
  'https': 'https://10.10.1.10:1080',
}
```
